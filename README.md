# Minimalist-Weather-Page-PlainJS

## Description

Simple weather app that uses the [weatherapi.com](https://weatherapi.com) API to fetch data from the chosen location.
I have tried to keep this as simple as possible and used only JavaScript linked in the HTML file. 
I used the `fetch` function to get the json data from the weather API.

## Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript
